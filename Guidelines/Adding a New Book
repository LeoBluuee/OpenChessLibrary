New book commit guideline:

Before making a book commit, check if the same edition is not already on the website. 
To do that, use the "readme" index file in the target language folder to search for title and/or author name. Carefully check all the information to not repeat an entry.

If the book truly is not already on the library index, proceed to make a commit on that same index file, with the following informations of the book (this must be in english, even if the book is not):

Title: (Full title of the book)
Author(s): (Full name of all the authors of the book)
Edition: (Which edition of the book)
Publishing Year: (Exact year when this edition was originally published)
Original Language: (Original language of the material, in case is translated)
Edition Language: (Which language is this edition written)
Typed/Scanned: (One or the other. Is it possible to copy the text or is it a scanned image?)
Notation: Algebraic/Descriptive 
TAGs: (This helps with database organization and user searches. More than one can be applied. Tags can be: General, Biography, Opening, Endgame, Tactics, Strategy, Chess Hitory, Puzzles, Periodical) 
Links: (Links to the book, from as many sources as possible)

There's a week period where your commit will be reviewed by the community to, specially, avoid any licencing issue.
