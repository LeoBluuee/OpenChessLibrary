# New book commit guideline:

Before making a book commit*, check if the same edition is not already on the website. 
To do that, use the "readme" index file in the target language folder to search for title and/or author name. Carefully check all the information to not repeat an entry.

If the book truly is not already on the index, proceed to make a commit on that file, with the following informations of the book (this must be in english, even if the book is not):

`<b>Title:</b>  (Title of the book)<br>` <br>
`<b>Author(s):</b>  (Full names of the book authors, in alphabetical order)<br>` <br>
`<b>Publishing Year:</b>  (Year of publication of the book)<br>` <br>
`<b>Links:</b> (Links to the book, from as many sources as possible) <br>` <br>

There's a period where your commit will be reviewed by the community to, specially, avoid any licencing issue.
