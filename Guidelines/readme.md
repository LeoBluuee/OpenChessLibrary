# Guidelines

This folder (will) contain all rules and guidelines for the Open Chess Library.
As a open source project, the idea is for the community and users to help make it bigger and better. The files on this folder explains how you can do that.

This includes, for now:

- Adding a New Book (How to add new books to the library)
- How to OCR a book (Free software and best procedures to OCR an old scanned book)
- How to translate a book (How to collectively translate an already OCRd book)
