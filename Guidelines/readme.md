# Guidelines

This repository is organized as follows:

For each language that we have a book in, a new folder will be created in this repository. Each of these folders will have a "readme" file cataloging all the books in that specific language in alphabetical order, organized by categories.

This folder contains all the rules, etiquette and guidelines of the Open Chess Library, like how to add new books, start an OCR or translation iniciative, etc.

While this project should work fine as a repository only, similar to the format of "Awesome Lists", the plan is to build a full website with a better UI for end users. There's a folder for all the website code and files called "Website".


This particular folder (will) contain all rules and guidelines for the Open Chess Library.
As a open source project, the idea is for the community and users to help make it bigger and better. The files on this folder explains how you can do that.

This includes, for now:

- Adding a New Book (How to add new books to the library);
- How to OCR a book (Free software and best procedures to OCR an old scanned book);
- How to translate a book (How to collectively translate an already OCRd book);
