# Open Chess Library


Project for cataloging, distributing and translating all copyright free Chess books in every language.

The current plan is:
- Find books that are certain to be copyright free on one of the sites mentioned below (or other sources);
- Catalog and distribute books for online read and download at the Open Chess Library website;
- Iniciatives for properly digitalizing (OCR) and translating books;

New books are added with a commit to this repository by anyone interested, following the proper guidelines, checked by the community, and then to the website after making sure everything is correct.

Books are taken from websites like:
- [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
- [Archive.org](http://archive.org/)
- [Google Books](https://books.google.com/)
- Amazon Books

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository is organized as follows:

For each language that we (OCL) have a book in, a new folder will be created here and the books in that particular language stored in the corresponding folder.
Each of these folders will have a "readme" and a JSON file cataloging all the books in that specific language in alphabetical order.

There's a folder containing all the rules, etiquette and guidelines of OCL, like how to add new books, start a OCR or translation iniciative, properly seed files for users download, etc.
More information on the "readme" file of the ["Guidelines"](https://github.com/LeoBluuee/OpenChessLibrary/tree/main/Guidelines) folder.

While this project should work fine as a repository only, similar to the format of "Awesome Lists", the plan is to build a full website with a better UI for end users.
There's a folder for all the website code and files called ["Website"](https://github.com/LeoBluuee/OpenChessLibrary/tree/main/Website).
