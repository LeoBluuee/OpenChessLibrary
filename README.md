# Open Chess Library


Project for cataloging, distributing and translating all copyright free Chess books in every language.

The current plan is:
- Find books that are certain to be copyright free on one of the sites mentioned below (or other sources);
- Catalog and distribute books for online read and download at the Open Chess Library website;
- Iniciatives for properly digitalizing (OCR) and translating books;

New books are added with a commit to this repository by anyone interested, following the proper guidelines, checked by the community, and then to the website after making sure everything is correct.

Books are taken from websites like:
- Project Gutenberg
- Archive.org
- Google Books
- Amazon Books
