This repository is organized as follows:

For each language that we (OCL) have a book in, a new folder will be created here and the books in that particular language stored in the corresponding folder.
Each of these folders will have a "readme" JSON file cataloging all the books in that specific language in alphabetical order.

There's a folder containing all the rules, etiquette and guidelines of OCL, like how to add new books, start a OCR or translation iniciative, properly seed files for users download, etc.
More information on the "readme" file of the "Rules, Etiquette and Guidelines" folder.

While this project should work fine as a repository only, similar to the format of "Awesome Lists", the plan is to build a full website with a better UI for end users.
There's a folder for all the website code and files called "Website".
